# SQL_challenge
Module 9

Overall Comment: This homework assignment was a lot of fun and very helpful to learn how to create databases in SQL as well as do basic queries in SQL. Specifically, I learned that the JOIN function worked much more efficiently than using sub-queries to query data. 

In order to use the code please do the following: 

1) Either open or copy and paste the script "Employee_Schema.mssql" into a Query in PGAdmin. This will create all of the necessary tables.

2) Once the tables are created, the data files (6 csv files) need to be imported into each table. Please see the comments on the "Employee_Schema" file to match the required csv files to the appropriate table. Additionally, I recommend that you import the data in the same order that the tables were created. 

3) Once all the data has been uploaded, open or copy and paste "Employee_Queries.mssql" into a Query in PGAdmin. Each of the eight queries are identified seperately and should be run seperately to query the data. 

In addition to the Schema and Query files, I created a "QuickDBD - ERD.png" file that visually displays the relationships between the tables, primary keys and foreign keys. Additionally, there is a "QuickDBD-ERD documentation.pdf" file that documents the ERD.
